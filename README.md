# Haskell Programming

A book based on the best examples and resrouces from all other Haskell books available today.

The biggest issue I have with programming books is that even thought the languages have mostly stayed the same, the compilers and packages change over time making it hard and costly to update books that are not digital. I have taken an inspiration from the Rust Programming Language book that is hosted online in order to create this one for haskell. Even though mdbook is a great tool for hosting books online it lacks the cusomizability that is easily available on honkit, compatibility with asciidoc and other options that are somewhat included in mdbook were also considered.

To run the site on your end simply
``` clone repo ```

serve the server
``` npx honkit serve ```

Updates from other is encouraged so please participate in the update of the documentation and the book as much as possible.

# Future work
I am looking forward to adding different dialects of haskell as well as different implementations of haskell such as Template haskell and others.
